"""Create project_members table

Revision ID: 0016
Revises: 0015
Create Date: 2026-07-24

The CRM Portal's "Assign/Remove Employee" panel on a project's detail page
already exists in the UI and already calls a real API on click, but the
Project table had no field to store it (only a single manager_id) — the
PUT was silently dropping the data and nothing ever persisted. This adds
a real join table so project team assignment actually works.
